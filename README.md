# McgillBot
Custodian of the McGill 2020 servers


Uses discord api to verify users across multiple servers. Also uses smtp protocols to facilitate email verification. 
A version is in production and holds up in a server of over 2000 people under heavy traffic.
Upkeep is done by a different user, this is just the original build.
